# üöÄ LLMover

**Free up disk space while keeping your LM Studio models accessible!**

A simple Python tool that moves your Large Language Model files to an external USB drive while maintaining full compatibility with LM Studio through symbolic links.

## üéØ Why Use This Tool?

**The Problem:**
- LM Studio doesn't let you choose where to download models
- Large models eat up your precious SSD space (often 50-200GB+ each!)
- No built-in way to move models after downloading

**The Solution:**
- Move models to external USB storage (cheap and expandable!)
- Keep LM Studio working exactly as before through "symbolic links"
- Safe operations with automatic backup and recovery

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üîç **Smart Detection** - Automatically finds and categorizes your models
- üìä **Storage Overview** - See exactly what's using your disk space
- üéõÔ∏è **Interactive Selection** - Choose exactly which models to move, bring back, or remove
- ‚ö° **Safe & Fast** - Atomic operations with automatic rollback on failure
- üîó **Seamless Integration** - LM Studio keeps working normally
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Estimates** - Know how long transfers will take
- üõ°Ô∏è **Health Monitoring** - Validates everything is working correctly
- üóëÔ∏è **Safe Removal** - Permanently delete models with multiple confirmation layers

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (check with `python3 --version`)
- **uv package manager** ([install here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- **macOS** (works with other systems but paths need adjustment)
- **External USB drive** with enough free space

**üìù Note:** The tool automatically creates a `config.yml` file with sensible defaults when you first run it. No manual configuration needed!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Download & Install
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:Nembus/LLMover.git
cd LLMover

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### 2. First Look (Safe - No Changes Made)
```bash
# See what models you have and their sizes
uv run llm-mover --list-only
# Or using the short flag
uv run llm-mover -ls
```

### 3. Move Models Interactively
```bash
# Interactive mode - you choose what to move
uv run llm-mover
```

That's it! The tool will guide you through the process.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Usage

### Custom Paths
```bash
# If your models or USB are in different locations
uv run llm-mover --local-path /path/to/models --usb-path /path/to/usb
# Or using short flags
uv run llm-mover -l /path/to/models -u /path/to/usb
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set once and forget - overrides config.yml settings
export LLM_LOCAL_PATH="/custom/model/path"
export LLM_USB_PATH="/Volumes/MyUSB/Models"
```

**üí° Tip:** The tool creates a `config.yml` file automatically with defaults. Environment variables override these settings, and command-line flags override everything.

### View Models on USB
```bash
# See what models are currently stored on your USB drive
uv run llm-mover --show-external
# Or using short flag
uv run llm-mover -se
```

### Bring Models Back from USB
```bash
# Move models from USB back to local storage
uv run llm-mover --bring-back
# Or using short flag
uv run llm-mover -bb
```

**What happens:**
- Shows models currently on USB (via symlinks)
- Lets you select which models to bring back
- Checks local storage space before proceeding
- Moves selected models from USB to local storage
- Removes symlinks (models are now fully local again)
- Shows space freed up on USB and used locally

**When to use:**
- You want to use certain models frequently without USB
- Working offline and need local access
- USB transfer speeds are too slow for regular use
- Preparing to remove or reformat the USB drive

### Remove Models Permanently
```bash
# Remove/delete models permanently to free up space
uv run llm-mover --remove
# Or using short flag
uv run llm-mover -rm

# Skip confirmation prompts (use with caution!)
uv run llm-mover --remove --force
uv run llm-mover -rm -f
```

**What happens:**
- Shows all models (both local and USB-stored)
- Lets you select which models to permanently delete
- Shows detailed breakdown by storage location
- Requires confirmation before deletion (unless --force is used)
- Removes models from both local storage and USB as needed
- Shows total space freed across all storage locations

**Safety features:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Double confirmation** for large deletions (>10GB or multiple models)
- üõ°Ô∏è **No accidental deletion** - requires explicit confirmation text
- üìä **Clear summary** showing exactly what will be deleted
- üîç **Smart handling** of different model types (local, symlinked, internal symlinks)

**When to use:**
- Clean up models you no longer need
- Free up space on both local storage and USB
- Remove outdated or duplicate models
- Clean slate before reorganizing your model collection

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** This action cannot be undone. Make sure you have backups if needed!

### Health Checking & Repair
```bash
# Check if all symlinks are working properly
uv run llm-mover --check-health
# Or using short flag
uv run llm-mover -ch

# Automatically repair broken symlinks
uv run llm-mover --repair
# Or using short flag
uv run llm-mover -r
```

### Verbose Mode
```bash
# See detailed information during operations
uv run llm-mover --verbose
# Or using short flag
uv run llm-mover -v
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Understanding Model Types

The tool automatically categorizes your models:

- **üóÇÔ∏è GGUF Models** - Standard quantized models (great for moving to USB)
- **üçé MLX Models** - Apple Silicon optimized (recommend keeping local for speed)  
- **üìÑ Single Files** - Individual model files
- **üìÅ Other** - Mixed or unknown content

**üí° Tip:** GGUF models are perfect candidates for USB storage since they're typically single large files that compress well and don't need ultra-fast access.

```

## üîí Safety & Recovery

**This tool is designed to be safe, but please backup your models before using it, as it has not been tested extensively!:**

‚úÖ **Atomic Operations** - Moves either complete 100% or rollback completely  
‚úÖ **Space Validation** - Checks available space before starting  
‚úÖ **Backup Creation** - Temporary backups during operations  
‚úÖ **Integrity Verification** - Confirms files transferred correctly  
‚úÖ **Health Monitoring** - Validates symbolic links are working  
‚úÖ **Automatic Recovery** - Rollback on any failure  

**If something goes wrong:** The tool automatically tries to restore your original setup.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "USB Not Detected"
- **Check mount point:** Your USB should appear at `/Volumes/USBSTICK/LMModels`
- **Different path?** Use `--usb-path /Volumes/YourUSBName/Models`
- **Not mounted?** Unplug and reconnect your USB drive

### "Permission Denied"
```bash
# Fix permissions for your models directory
chmod -R u+rw ~/.lmstudio/models/
```

### "LM Studio Can't Find Models"
- This shouldn't happen with proper symlinks
- Run health check to diagnose issues: `uv run llm-mover --check-health`
- Use automatic repair: `uv run llm-mover --repair`
- Use `--verbose` to see detailed error information

### Symlink Issues
```bash
# Diagnose symlink problems
uv run llm-mover --check-health --verbose

# Automatically fix broken symlinks
uv run llm-mover --repair

# Check what's actually on your USB
uv run llm-mover --show-external
```

### Need Help?
```bash
# Get detailed output for troubleshooting
uv run llm-mover --verbose --list-only

# Complete diagnostic workflow
uv run llm-mover --check-health -v
uv run llm-mover --show-external -v

# View all available options
uv run llm-mover --help
```

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will this break LM Studio?**  
A: No! LM Studio will continue working normally. The symbolic links make it appear as if models are still in the original location.

**Q: What if I unplug my USB drive?**  
A: LM Studio won't be able to load models stored on the USB until you plug it back in. Models still on local storage continue working.

**Q: Can I move models back to local storage?**  
A: Yes! Use `uv run llm-mover --bring-back` to interactively select and move models from USB back to local storage. The tool will remove symlinks and transfer files safely.

**Q: How much space will I save?**  
A: It depends on your models! You could save hundreds of GB. Run `uv run llm-mover --list-only` to see potential savings.

**Q: Is this reversible?**  
A: Yes! The file operations are completely reversible. Use `uv run llm-mover --bring-back` to automatically move models back to local storage and clean up symlinks.
